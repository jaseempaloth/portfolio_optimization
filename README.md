2.	Data preparation and cleaning
3.	Calculation of key financial metrics (expected returns, volatility, Sharpe Ratio)
4.	Portfolio simulation
5.	Visualization of results using matplotlib
6.	Optimization of portfolio weights using scipy

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1.	Data Collection: Use yfinance to gather financial data.
2.	Data Preparation: Clean and organize the data for analysis.
3.	Metrics Calculation: Compute expected returns, volatility, and Sharpe Ratio.
